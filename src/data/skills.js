It is generally used to speed up application deployment, create a continuous delivery pipeline, and monitor infrastructure. By converting infrastructure to code, Chef makes infrastructure configuration versionable, testable, and repeatable.</p>\n\n<p>This competency area includes an understanding of configuration management in Chef, an understanding of Chef architecture, exploring the Chef workflow, understanding Cookbooks,&nbsp;Recipes, and Knives,&nbsp;creating, deleting, listing, and downloading cookbooks, viewing information of a node, among others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Key Competencies:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Configuration management </strong>- An understanding of configuration management in Chef. It&nbsp;is a process for maintaining computer systems, servers, and software in a desired, consistent state. It is a process that makes sure that systems and software perform consistently across a cluster as expected as changes are made over time.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Node</strong> - Nodes are end-point machines where the Chef client is installed. These include laptops, desktops, mainframes, edge devices, etc.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chef Architecture</strong> - An understanding of Chef architecture. Chef&nbsp;follows a client-server architecture. The architecture contains the following key components:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><em>Workstation -</em>&nbsp;A workstation is a machine in which Chef is installed and configurations are developed and then uploaded to the Chef server.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><em>Chef Server -</em>&nbsp;The Chef server is the hub where all the configuration data is stored, which includes, the cookbooks, node policies, metadata of the managed nodes.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><em>Chef Client -</em>&nbsp;The Chef client is installed in the nodes which check for updated cookbooks in the chef server and execute the cookbook on the node.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Workflow</strong> - Exploring the Chef Workflow - Workstation, a chef server, and a chef-client [for one or more nodes] is set up. Cookbooks are configured on the workstation and pushed to the chef-server which acts as a hub for storing configuration data for the managed cluster. Meanwhile, the chef clients keep polling the chef server for new cookbooks or any changes made to the cookbooks. In case a change is required, the chef-client retrieves the cookbook and executes the instructions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Understanding Cookbooks and Recipes</strong> - Cookbooks are the fundamental units of configuration management with Chef. They contain information about the desired state of a node (or a cluster of nodes). Cookbooks are a collection of one or more recipes. Recipes are written in Ruby that define a particular configuration or policy of a node. Recipes can be written for setting up software on a machine to setting or changing values of resources and more.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Understanding Knife</strong> - Knife is a command-line interface (CLI) which is the primary way that the workstation communicates or interfaces with the Chef server. Awareness&nbsp;of basic commands with a knife such as creating, deleting, listing, and downloading cookbooks, viewing information of a node, etc. are included in this competency.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages </strong>- Chef has four key advantages: highly scalable (supports many nodes and multi-cloud environments), interoperable (chef client&rsquo;s can be windows or Linux machines), good support on AWS, and a dependable enterprise version. Disadvantages: Uses ruby for writing configuration, cookbooks are maintained in a common workspace (hard to maintain and avoid mistakes), not easy to manage (a dedicated person is required to manage the workstation), and a community and advanced documentation are lacking.</li>\n</ol>\n",

It is a process that makes sure the systems and software perform consistently across a cluster as expected as changes are made over time.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Puppet Architecture</strong> - Working with the Puppet Architecture and using its components, is included in this competency. The Puppet architectures follow a master-slave framework, with the following key components:\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li><strong>Puppet Master</strong> - The Puppet Master is a server that manages the configuration of a cluster of machines.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Puppet Agent </strong>- The Puppet agent is a working machine that is managed by the Puppet master. They constantly poll the master for any changes that need to be made in its configuration or current state.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Config Repository</strong> - It is a repository for storage and retrieval of all node and server-related configurations.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Key components in Puppet</strong> - Understanding the&nbsp;key components in Puppet.&nbsp;<strong>Catalog</strong> is a compiled format of all manifests or configurations that need to be sent to a puppet agent. <strong>Modules</strong> are a collection of resources, manifests, classes, files, definitions, and templates. Manifest files are written in Ruby and Puppet DSL and contain the code for the configuration desired on a target machine for a particular policy or a state, and <strong>Facts</strong> are information of resources or a state of a particular agent or master.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Understanding Puppet Workflow</strong> - Ability to understand and work with the Puppet Workflow, which is:&nbsp;the agent constantly polls the master at periodic intervals. The &#39;facter&#39; collects facts about the state of a client and sends them to the master, the master compiles manifests into catalogs and sends it to the client, the agent on the client initiates the catalog and generates and sends a report about the changes made on the client to the master.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Basic Puppet DSL</strong> - Exploring the&nbsp;basics of Puppet DSL.&nbsp;This includes, keywords (include, service, package, ensure, enable, etc), classes, setting attribute values, conditionals, and variables.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages</strong> -&nbsp; Advantages: Puppet forge provides a large number of open-source modules, large developer community, scalable, fault-tolerant, supports test driven development. Disadvantages: uses ruby and Puppet DSL to describe the configuration, takes longer to set-up compared to simpler competitors, uses pull-configuration, and hence doesn&rsquo;t support instantaneous deployment natively, reporting is limited.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Use tuples which are arrays in which we can define the data type of each element in the array.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Type annotations, Interface, and assertions</strong> -&nbsp;Use specific types for each variable defined.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Functions</strong> - Use functions for performing a set of actions. Create functions with typed parameters, return type annotations, function overloads, default parameter values, rest parameters. Create named functions and anonymous functions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Class</strong> - Use of object-oriented class-based approach to creating objects.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inheritance</strong> - Use of&nbsp;Inheritance to receive the features, interactions, and behaviors of a class by another class.</li>\n</ol>\n",
